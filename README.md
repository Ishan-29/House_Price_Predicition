This data science project is based on real state properties price prediction. First I have build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Secondly I have written a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
During model building I have applied various techniques like cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.

Technologies used in this project:

1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
